# Face Recognition System

## Overview

This project implements a face recognition system that can identify and recognize faces from images by comparing them against a trained dataset of known faces. When an input image is provided, the system will identify the person if they are in the trained dataset and return their name.

## Features

- **Face Recognition:** Accurately identifies known faces in images.
- **Customizable Dataset:** Easily add or remove faces from the training dataset.
- **Pre-trained Model:** Utilizes a pre-trained model for face detection and recognition.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- dlib
- face_recognition
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- imutils

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Bereket-07/faceRecognition-project.git
    cd 1ststep -- for just marking the face
    cd 2ndstep -- for the pretraind program on some data
    cd 3rdstep  -- for measuring the accuracy
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    `bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    `
